# Bookmark Resume Test Results

## Changes Made:

1. **Fixed DOM Generation Blocking Issue**
   - Removed `pointerEvents: isResumeMode ? 'none' : 'auto'` from text container (line 1488)
   - Changed to use CSS blur effect: `className={max-w-none ${isResumeMode ? 'blur-reading' : ''}}`

2. **Updated CSS Blur Class**
   - Re-enabled `filter: blur(4px)` for visual feedback
   - Removed `pointer-events: none` that was blocking DOM element generation
   - Added comment explaining the reason

3. **Fixed isResumeMode Initialization**
   - Removed "emergency measure" that forced `isResumeMode=false`
   - Changed to properly detect `resume=1` URL parameter during initialization
   - This ensures proper state from the beginning

## Expected Behavior:

### Before Fix:
- ❌ `totalElements: 0` during bookmark resume
- ❌ No DOM elements generated
- ❌ No scrolling to bookmark position
- ❌ No red highlighting of bookmarked word

### After Fix:
- ✅ DOM elements should be generated even in resume mode
- ✅ `renderClickableText` should be called and create `[data-idx]` elements
- ✅ `waitForElements` should find the target element
- ✅ Automatic scrolling to bookmark position should work
- ✅ Red highlighting should appear for 3 seconds
- ✅ Page scrolling should remain enabled throughout

## Test Instructions:

1. **Create a bookmark:**
   - Go to http://localhost:3001/reading/bucket-list/2
   - Double-tap any word to create bookmark
   - Confirm creation in dialog

2. **Test resume:**
   - Should redirect to `/choose` with resume button
   - Click "前回の続きを読む" 
   - Should go to reading page with `resume=1` parameter
   - Text should appear blurred initially
   - Resume dialog should appear
   - Click "読書を再開する"

3. **Verify fix:**
   - Text should unblur
   - Page should automatically scroll to bookmarked word
   - Bookmarked word should be highlighted in red for 3 seconds
   - Page scrolling should work normally
   - Console should show DOM elements found (not 0)

## Debug Console Commands:

```javascript
// Check DOM elements are generated
document.querySelectorAll('[data-idx]').length

// Check if specific bookmark index exists
document.querySelector('[data-idx="417"]')

// Verify scrolling works
window.scrollTo(0, 100)
```

## Status: Ready for Testing

The core issue (DOM elements not being generated during resume) should now be resolved.
