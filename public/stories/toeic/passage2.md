Hi David,

Thanks for the update. I've reviewed the revised timeline. The new deadline of December 10th for the initial prototype seems achievable. However, I'm concerned about the testing phase, which is scheduled for only three days. Given the complexity of the new features, I suggest we allocate at least a full week for testing. What are your thoughts?

Best,
Sarah

Hi Sarah,

That's a valid point. I agree that three days is a bit tight for testing. Let me discuss this with the team and see if we can adjust the schedule. I will get back to you by the end of the day.

Regards,
David
