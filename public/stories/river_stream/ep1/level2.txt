*1 Leaving Home
-Rick lost his truck job three weeks ago. Now he starts drinking at noon and keeps drinking until the night is deep. Rain hits the broken kitchen window, but Rick hears only his anger. He shouts bad words and throws a wooden chair. The chair breaks against the wall, and one leg rolls across the floor. Then he cracks a bottle and cuts Huck’s arm with the sharp glass. Blood runs down Huck’s wrist and drops onto the cold tiles.

-Huck is fifteen. Two months ago he tried to run away. Police officers who play cards with Rick caught him at the bus stop and dragged him home. They said his bruises were “family matters” and drove away. Huck learned that police help will not come. Since that day he has kept one dream: leave for good when the house is quiet.

-His old phone is his only strong tool. After school he sits by the river and sings easy songs into the phone. Online viewers send small tips. Half of the money buys bread and soap. The rest goes under his thin mattress. Rick often takes coins for beer, but Huck always saves a few.

-This Friday night Rick drinks even more. Close to midnight he falls onto the torn sofa and begins to snore. Huck listens to the steady sound, counts to forty, and walks to his small room. He takes the phone, a power bank, a flashlight, one spare shirt, and a blanket. He packs them in an old school bag.

-He opens his stream and whispers, “I need a safe place near the river tonight.” His voice shakes, yet the words are clear. Viewers answer with short lines of hope. A user called RiverAngel writes, Empty houseboat under Miller Bridge. Rope still tied. Safe until morning. Huck thanks her, ends the stream, and lifts his window.

-Cold rain touches his face. He steps into the dark yard and pulls the window down again so Rick will not feel moving air. Wet grass makes his shoes slip, but he keeps walking. He stays close to fences so car lights cannot see him. A stray dog lifts its head but stays quiet. The phone buzzes; new tips and short prayers feel like small hands pushing him forward.

-Miller Bridge stands over the slow river at the edge of town. A weak lamp shows wet boards and a metal rail. Huck climbs the rail and drops to the muddy bank. The river smells of rain and old wood. Ahead a houseboat rocks gently. A thick rope ties it to a tree root. Most paint is gone, but the roof looks dry. Huck tests each step on the narrow plank before walking onto the deck.

-Inside he finds two broken chairs and a rusty stove. One corner drips, so he lays his blanket in the driest spot. He presses a towel on the cut until the blood slows. Then he starts a low‑light stream. “I am safe for now,” he tells the watchers. “Tomorrow I will wash the cut, buy bread, and show you the river.” Many heart icons climb the screen. Huck feels his shoulders relax.

-He ends the stream and lies down. The boat rocks like a slow song. For the first time in weeks Huck can breathe without fear. Then a small scratch moves along the outside of the boat and breaks the quiet.
