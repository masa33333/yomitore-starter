*1 Leaving Home

-Rick had been fired from the truck company three weeks earlier, and since that day he had replaced breakfast with cheap beer. While midnight rain beat against the cracked window glass, he threw a wooden chair, which broke apart against the wall and slid across the floor. A moment later he smashed a bottle and pushed the sharp glass against Huck’s arm, cutting a thin red line that dripped onto the tiles.

-Huck, who was Rick’s adopted son and had just turned fifteen, lived with this violence every week. Two months earlier he had run to the town police station and begged for help. By bad luck the officer on duty was Rick’s card‑playing friend, a man who often spent Sunday nights drinking at Rick’s house. That officer took Huck back home, called the blue marks on the boy’s skin “a private family problem,” and closed the report. From that clear failure Huck learned that outside rescue was impossible, so he began to plan a second escape on his own.

-The old phone that guided him worked as both tool and hope. Each afternoon, after finishing school, he sat near the river and streamed simple songs. Viewers who liked his quiet voice sent tiny online tips. Half of the money bought bread, soap, and batteries; the other half was hidden under the mattress that covered his narrow bed. Rick often grabbed the phone and took coins for beer, yet a secret supply survived every search.

-On the first Friday of the long rainy season, Rick drank until his eyes closed. After midnight he lay snoring on the torn sofa, an empty can rolling on its side by his foot. Knowing that the house was finally safe to cross, Huck packed a small escape kit: the phone, a power bank, a torch, one clean shirt, and the blanket that had followed him since childhood. All the items went into a faded school bag whose zipper still worked.

-Sitting on the bed, he opened the streaming app and whispered, “I need a safe place near the river tonight.” Although fear shook his voice, listeners answered in seconds. A message from RiverAngel appeared: Empty houseboat under Miller Bridge. Rope still tied. Safe until dawn. Huck wrote a quick thank‑you, ended the stream, and lifted the stiff window frame. Cool rain touched his face while he slipped outside and pulled the glass down again so no fresh air would wake Rick.

-Wet grass brushed his shoes as he followed back lanes, keeping close to fences so passing headlights could not find him. From time to time the phone vibrated with new tips and short words of courage; those gentle signals felt like unseen hands pushing him forward.

-When the last streetlight ended, Miller Bridge rose ahead, its wet boards shining under a single lamp. Huck climbed the metal rail, dropped to the muddy bank, and breathed the river’s mixed smell of rain and old wood. The houseboat, which was tied to a strong tree root by one thick rope, rocked gently in the slow current. Although most paint had peeled away, the roof looked firm, and that simple fact gave him unexpected comfort.

-He tested each plank of the short walkway before adding weight, then entered the cabin, where two broken chairs leaned against a rusty stove. One corner dripped, so he spread the blanket on the driest boards. After pressing a towel against the cut until the bleeding slowed, he restarted the stream under dim light. “I made it to the boat,” he told the small audience. “Tomorrow I will clean the cut, buy bread, and show you the sunrise over the river.” Heart icons floated upward, and Huck released a breath he felt he had held for days.

-The river pushed softly under the hull, moving the boat like a cradle. Sleep began to pull at his eyes, and, for the first time in weeks, his shoulders rested against the blanket. Huck felt safe at last; just then, a faint, rough scrape slid along the boat’s outside wall and broke the night’s quiet.
