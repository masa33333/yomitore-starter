*1 Leaving Home
-Rain hits the broken window of the small kitchen.
Rick drinks heavy beer from noon until his head spins.
He yells, throws a chair, and the wall shakes.
Huck stands near the door and holds his hurt arm.

He feels a warm line of blood move to his hand.
Rick shouts again, then falls onto the torn sofa asleep.
Huck watches and thinks about one safe place in town.
He must leave tonight before new pain starts again.

Huck owns only one tool for hope: his small phone.
He streams soft songs after school and gets tiny online tips.
Rick often grabs the phone and takes half the money.
Yet Huck hides some coins under the thin mattress.

Tonight Rick sleeps deeper, his loud snore fills the house.
Huck moves to his room and packs a small bag.
He takes phone, blanket, light, and one clean shirt.
He starts a secret stream and speaks in a low voice.

He whispers, “I must leave this house now, need a safe place.”
A user called RiverAngel answers in seconds, very quickly.
The message says an empty houseboat waits under Miller Bridge tonight.
Huck thanks the stranger, ends the stream, and climbs outside.

Cold rain hits his face and makes the cut sting.
He walks along small yards and stays close to dark fences.
Street dogs stay silent, and no light follows him.
His phone buzzes with more tips and short prayers.

Miller Bridge stands high above the slow dark river.
Old boards shine wet under the weak street lamp.
Huck climbs over the rail and drops to soft mud.
He sees the houseboat, and it rocks like a tired horse.

One thick rope ties the boat to a strong tree root.
Most paint is gone, but the small roof looks dry.
Huck steps onto the deck and tests each board.
He opens the door and smells wet wood inside.

Two broken chairs and a rusty stove sit near the wall.
Huck lays his blanket in the driest corner.
He starts a low light stream for his small audience.
“I am safe,” he says, “I will clean my arm tomorrow.”

Huck presses a towel on the cut until bleeding slows.
The river pushes under the boat and rocks him gently.
For the first time in weeks his eyes close easily.
He feels sure Rick cannot reach him here soon.

Huck feels safe for the first time; his fear is gone. 
Then a small scratch moves outside the boat and breaks the quiet.
Huck sits up and his heart beats like fast drums.
Heavy boots step onto the deck, and the wood gives a moan.
The door latch moves once, then stops, and night holds breath.

Huck grips his flashlight and waits for the unknown visitor.
He hopes the river noise hides his quick breath.
Outside, the steps stop, and empty silence fills the air.
