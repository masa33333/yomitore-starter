**1. Two different lives
--Notting Hill is a small part of west London. The streets are colourful; many people sell fruit, clothes, and used things on Portobello Road.
There is a tiny travel-book shop on that road. William (Will) Thacker owns it. He is 35, quiet, and kind. After a hard divorce he now lives in a small house with a funny flat-mate, Spike. Spike is from Wales and often walks in the house wearing only underpants.

Far away in Hollywood lives Anna Scott, maybe the most famous movie star in the world. Magazines show her face every week. Reporters follow her all day.
Will is “a normal man.” Anna is “a superstar.” But both feel lonely in their own way.

**2. A surprise in the book shop
--One morning the shop was almost empty. At 11 o’clock a woman in dark glasses came in. She looked at books about Turkey. Will soon knew who she was: Anna Scott! He tried to stay calm. She chose one book, paid, and left with a small smile.

Five minutes later Will left the shop to buy orange juice. As he turned the corner he walked straight into Anna. The paper cup broke. Juice covered her white blouse.
Will said “sorry!” many times. He offered his house nearby so she could clean her clothes. Anna agreed.

At Will’s house she changed into a T-shirt that said “Get Laid in Iceland” (Spike’s joke T-shirt). She laughed at the words. Before leaving, Will suddenly asked, “Would you like tea or coffee with me one day?”
Anna thought for a second, wrote her phone number on paper, and said “maybe.” Then a car took her away.

**3. A very strange meeting at the hotel
--Will planned to call Anna the next day, but her helper phoned first. Anna had press interviews at the Ritz hotel. Will could meet her there in the afternoon.

Will put on an old suit and went to the hotel. He forgot Anna’s secret code name “Flintstone,” so the staff were confused. At last a worker sent him to Anna’s room. A long line of reporters waited. A staff member thought Will was a reporter and pushed him inside.

Anna sat on a sofa, bored. She whispered, “Pretend you are a reporter.” Will knew nothing about news work, so he said he wrote for a kids’ magazine called Horse & Hound! He asked silly questions about space films, horses, and dogs. Anna answered and tried not to laugh. When the real reporters were gone, Anna said sorry for the mix-up and asked Will to have dinner that evening.

But Will had a promise: he must go to his sister Honey’s birthday dinner. Anna said, “No problem. Ask if I can come.” Will agreed.

**4. Birthday dinner with friends
--At the dinner table were:

Max and Bella – Will’s best friends; Bella now used a wheelchair.

Bernie – a kind but clumsy banker.

Honey – Will’s lively sister, now 27.

Will, very nervous.

Anna, wearing simple clothes, no make-up.

At first nobody knew she was famous. Then Honey screamed, Bernie asked many funny questions, and Bella told her sad story about acting school. Anna listened and laughed; she felt normal for once.

After dinner they played a game: who had the worst life would win the last piece of cake. Each person spoke. Anna said her armpits looked bad after shaving. The others laughed and gave her the cake.

Later Anna and Will walked home. Outside Will’s gate they shared a small kiss. Anna left with a happy smile.

**5. Reporters everywhere
--The next morning Spike opened the front door wearing only grey pants. Flash! Flash! A crowd of paparazzi took photos. Someone had told the newspapers Anna stayed at Will’s house.

Reporters shouted rude questions. Anna was afraid and angry. Will tried to stop the crowd but could not. In the papers the next day the headline was “ANNA & NOBODY?” Anna felt hurt. That night she climbed over the back fence and flew to America without saying goodbye.

Will was heart-broken. He worked, ate cheap food, and tried to forget her, but he could not.

**6. Meeting again, but saying no
--Six months passed. One day Anna called the book shop. She was back in London for a new film and wanted to see Will. They met in the closed shop at night. Anna said sorry for leaving. She also said her American boyfriend had sold private phone calls to the press, so she trusted almost no one now.

Will listened but was still afraid of new pain. He said he could not start again. Anna looked sad and left.

**7. Love wins at the press conference
--A few days later Spike shouted, “Will, come see the TV!” On the screen Anna answered questions at a press conference. A nasty reporter asked if she liked breaking a “normal man’s” heart. Anna stopped, then said softly,

“I’m just a girl, standing in front of a boy, asking him to love her.”

Will’s heart jumped. Spike yelled, “Go to her!”
Will and his friends raced by car to the hotel. He ran into the press room, out of breath. Reporters turned to look. Will said he had been stupid and asked Anna if she would still have dinner with him.

Anna’s face changed from shock to joy. She said “yes.” Cameras flashed, but this time everyone cheered.

Later Anna finished her film in London and often visited Will’s shop. They took one friendly photo for the newspaper, then asked the reporters to leave them alone.

Some months later Will and Anna had a small wedding in a garden. Friends and family danced under lights. Time passed. One sunny day Will sat on a park bench reading a book. Anna, now pregnant, lay with her head on his shoulder. They were happy, and Notting Hill felt like the best place in the world.
