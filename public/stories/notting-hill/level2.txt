**1. A Colourful London Street
--Notting Hill, in west London, is famous for its Saturday market. Every morning fruit sellers lift heavy boxes, clothes traders hang bright shirts, and tourists look for cheap antiques on Portobello Road. Halfway along the street stands a narrow travel-book shop. The owner, William Thacker, is thirty-five. He is friendly, careful with money, and still sad about a divorce that happened two years ago.

William lives five minutes away with a Welsh flat-mate named Spike. Spike is kind but messy. He often walks through the house wearing only old underpants and talks to himself while searching for clean socks. William accepts Spike’s strange habits because London rent is high.

**2. A Very Famous Customer
--Late one Tuesday morning a woman in dark glasses enters the shop. She wears simple jeans and a cap. William welcomes her. After a moment he realises the woman is Anna Scott, one of the most famous film stars in the world. He stays calm, shows her a guidebook about Turkey, and takes her credit card. Anna thanks him and leaves.

Only five minutes later William buys a paper cup of orange juice. He turns a corner and bumps straight into Anna. The cup bursts; orange juice covers her white blouse. William apologises again and again. He offers his nearby house, so she can clean her clothes. Anna says yes.

**3. “Get Laid in Iceland”
--At the house William searches Spike’s wardrobe and finds one clean T-shirt. The words “Get Laid in Iceland” are printed across the chest. Anna laughs and puts it on. She is about to leave when William suddenly says, “Would you like to drink coffee with me some time?” Anna writes her phone number on a scrap of paper and says, “Maybe.”

In the afternoon an assistant phones the shop. Anna is giving short interviews at the Ritz hotel. If William wants to see her, he can come at four o’clock. William borrows an old suit from Spike and rushes to the hotel.

**4. Horse & Hound
--At the hotel William forgets Anna’s secret code name, “Flintstone.” The staff think he is a reporter and send him into a suite already full of journalists. Anna sits on a sofa. She whispers, “Pretend you are from a magazine.” William invents a children’s magazine called Horse & Hound and asks about her space film, horses, and dogs. Anna answers, trying not to laugh.

When the real reporters leave, Anna invites William to dinner. William explains he must attend his sister Honey’s birthday party. Anna smiles and offers to join the party instead.

**5. A Birthday to Remember
--That evening William’s kitchen is full. At the table are:

Max and Bella – William’s best friends. Bella uses a wheelchair after an accident.

Bernie – a banker who never notices famous people.

Honey – William’s lively sister, crazy about celebrities.

William, worried.

Anna, wearing no make-up and simple clothes.

At first nobody recognises her. Honey suddenly realises and screams with joy. Bernie asks Anna which part of the movie business she cleans. Everyone laughs when he discovers the truth. After dinner the group play a game: whoever has the worst problem wins the last slice of cake. Anna jokes that her underarms look terrible after shaving, so the others give her the cake.

After the party Anna and William walk through quiet streets. Outside his gate they share a small kiss. Anna leaves with a gentle smile.

**6. Cameras Crash the Peace
--Next morning Spike opens the front door wearing only grey pants. A crowd of paparazzi with flashing cameras fill the street. Somebody told them that Anna spent the night at William’s house. Reporters shout rude questions. Anna is frightened and angry. Newspapers next day scream “ANNA & NOBODY?” Anna blames Spike and also William. That night she climbs over the back fence and flies to the United States without saying goodbye.

William is heart-broken. He works in the shop, eats cheap takeaway food, and tries to forget. Friends arrange dates, but he still thinks of Anna.

**7. A Second Meeting
--Six months later Anna returns to London to shoot a film. She calls William and asks to meet after closing time. In the silent shop she says sorry for leaving. She explains that her American boyfriend sold private phone messages to the press, so she trusts nobody. William listens but fears new pain. He decides not to begin again. Anna leaves in tears.

**8. Words That Change Everything
--A few days later Spike tells William to look at the television. Anna is speaking at a press conference. A rude reporter asks if she enjoys breaking a “normal man’s” heart. Anna pauses, then says,

“I’m just a girl, standing in front of a boy, asking him to love her.”

Spike shouts, “She means you!” William grabs Bernie’s car keys. Spike, Honey, Max, and Bella jump in too. They race through London, make wrong turns, and reach the hotel as Anna leaves the stage. William, out of breath, tells her he was stupid and asks for another chance. Anna smiles and says “yes.” Reporters cheer.

**9. A New Life Together
--A quiet photo of Anna and William standing outside the travel shop appears once in a newspaper. After that reporters lose interest. Months later the couple marry in Max and Bella’s garden. Spike forgets the rings but finds them in time. Honey dates the best man.

One sunny afternoon William sits on a park bench reading. Anna, now pregnant, lies with her head on his lap. A single photographer takes one photo from far away, but the couple do not notice. They have mixed their worlds—film sets and market stalls, red carpets and second-hand books—and found a peaceful life in Notting Hill.
