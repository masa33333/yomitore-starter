**1. Market Noise and Quiet Books
--Portobello Road wakes early. Stalls clang open; traders spread bright cloths to protect fruit from the sun; visitors search for treasures among boxes of bric-à-brac. Near the centre stands a narrow shop with a fading wooden board: “The Travel Book Co.” Inside, shelves are full of guides to deserts, cold mountains, and lost cities. William Thacker manages the place with gentle humour, though the business barely covers his rent.

William’s private life is equally modest. Two years after a difficult divorce he shares a crumbling house with Spike, an untidy Welsh man who enjoys loud guitar music and walks around in underwear bearing strange slogans. William often tidies the kitchen while Spike sings into a hairbrush.

**2. A Superstar in Disguise
--Late on a warm Tuesday morning a woman wearing sunglasses and a baseball cap walks into the shop. She browses travel guides on Turkey. William approaches, ready to help, and suddenly realises he is serving Anna Scott, one of Hollywood’s most famous actresses. He keeps his voice steady, completes the sale, and watches her leave.

Five minutes later William buys an orange-juice carton. Turning a corner, he collides with Anna. The juice explodes, soaking her white blouse. William apologises and, embarrassed, invites her to his nearby house to change. Anna smiles and accepts.

**3. T-Shirt Diplomacy
--Spike’s wardrobe offers one clean garment: a bright turquoise T-shirt reading “Get Laid in Iceland.” Anna laughs and puts it on. Before leaving, William gathers his courage and asks if she might like coffee sometime. She pauses, writes her number on a scrap of paper, and says, “Maybe.”

That afternoon an assistant calls. Anna is spending the day giving interviews at the Ritz under the code name “Flintstone.” If William comes at four, she can spare five minutes.

**4. Horse & Hound Improvisation
--William borrows Spike’s least offensive suit and reaches the Ritz, where staff confuse him for a journalist. Inside a suite crowded with reporters Anna silently instructs him to act like one. William invents Horse & Hound, “Britain’s leading magazine on equestrian space travel,” and asks absurd questions about saddles in zero gravity. Anna answers with professional calm while hiding a grin.

When the press session ends Anna invites William to dinner. He explains that he must attend his sister Honey’s birthday. Anna offers to come. William, half terrified, agrees.

**5. Dinner, Cake, and Honest Stories
--That evening William’s kitchen hosts an unusual set of guests:

Max, a chef turned stockbroker, and his wife Bella, recently using a wheelchair.

Bernie, a banker who never recognises famous faces.

Honey, whose excitement often outruns her good sense.

William, sweating in silence.

Anna Scott, dressed simply, no make-up, enjoying a moment away from cameras.

At first nobody realises who she is. Bernie asks what part of the film industry she cleans. Honey, sudden recognition glowing in her eyes, almost cries with delight. Bella speaks with Anna about acting dreams and lost chances.

After dinner Max brings a sticky-toffee pudding. They invent a game: the person with the worst life earns the last slice. Bella jokes about daily wheelchair problems, Bernie laments constant financial failure, and Anna, pretending to be average, comments on terrible under-arm shaving. The table votes to give her the cake.

Walking home in soft lamplight, Anna thanks William for the honest evening. Outside his gate she kisses him. William, stunned, watches her ride away.

**6. Fame Breaks the Door
--Next morning Spike opens the front door wearing only underwear and decorative goggles. Dozens of paparazzi wait outside. They learned Anna spent the night in the house. Flashbulbs strobe; reporters shout. Anna, trapped in the kitchen, panics. The headline “ANNA & NOBODY?” fills morning papers. Furious, she blames Spike—who told a friend in the pub—then blames William. That night she scales the back fence and catches a flight to Los Angeles without farewell.

William drifts into grey routine. He serves guidebooks, eats supermarket pasta, and agrees to hopeless blind dates arranged by friends. Nothing helps; memories of Anna remain.

**7. Six Months Later
--Half a year passes. Anna returns to London to film a Henry James adaptation. She calls William. They meet in the closed shop at dusk. Anna apologises but explains her trust was broken when her American boyfriend sold private voicemail messages to tabloids. William listens, feels fear of fresh pain, and decides against restarting the relationship. Anna leaves, eyes bright with unshed tears.

**8. A Press Conference Confession
--A few days later Spike bursts into the shop, shouting about the television. Anna is at a press conference. A hostile reporter asks if she likes destroying an ordinary man’s heart. Anna pauses, then replies:

“Yes, a man owns a travel-book shop in Notting Hill. I hurt him. But now I’m just a girl, standing in front of a boy, asking him to love her.”

Spike yells, “That’s you, mate!”

**9. A Wild London Chase
--William drags Spike, Honey, Max, and Bella into Bernie’s tiny car. They race through traffic, miss the hotel entrance, reverse down a one-way street, and finally burst into the hotel ballroom just as the conference ends. Reporters stare. William apologises publicly, admits he was stupid, and asks Anna to dinner. Anna smiles and says “yes.” The room explodes in applause and camera flashes, but for once the noise feels friendly.

**10. After the Headlines Fade
--One polite photograph of Anna and William outside the book shop appears in a newspaper under the headline “HAPPY IN NOTTING HILL.” Reporters soon move on to new scandals.

Months later Anna and William marry in Max and Bella’s garden. Spike forgets the rings, finds them inside his shoe, and becomes best-man by accident. Honey dances with a waiter.
When Anna rests between films she helps William rearrange dusty shelves; when she travels, William closes the shop early and joins her on set.

**11. A Quiet Park Scene
--One spring afternoon William reads aloud from a travel guide to Greece while sitting on a park bench. Anna, now pregnant, lies with her head on his lap. A single photographer, hidden behind a tree, captures the moment. The caption next day reads, “STAR ENJOYS PEACE.”

William and Anna no longer mind the occasional lens. They have mixed two worlds—bookshop calm and red-carpet rush—and built a life that feels balanced. In busy London, love and ordinary days finally belong to both of them.
