*1. Two men, one room
-Edward Cole is a very rich man in his middle sixties. He owns many hospitals and always travels with three mobile phones. Carter Chambers is the same age but fixes cars in a small garage. He loves books, quiz shows, and his big family.
Both men learn they have serious lung cancer and must stay in the same hospital room. Edward is angry about sharing. Carter is friendly and tries small talk, but Edward only watches TV.

*2. A list begins
-One night Carter writes on yellow paper. It is his bucket list—things to do before he “kicks the bucket,” which means before he dies. Edward laughs, grabs the paper, and adds crazy ideas: jump from a plane, race a fast car, kiss the most beautiful girl in the world. Carter says those things cost too much. Edward smiles. “I have money,” he says.

*3. A big choice
-Doctors say strong medicine may give each man twelve more months, but the medicine will be painful. Without it, they may have six good months. Edward stops the medicine. Carter thinks hard, talks to his wife, and also stops. Edward offers his jet and credit cards to finish the list together. Carter’s wife is worried but wants Carter happy. She agrees.

*4. Sky over the desert
-First, they skydive. Edward screams with joy; Carter screams with fear, then starts laughing in the sky. Next, they race two Shelby Mustangs on a track. Carter drives like a boy again. Edward tries to pass, spins on the grass, and laughs until he cries.

*5. Food, bikes, and big stones
-In France they eat at a fine restaurant. Edward teaches Carter table rules. Carter teaches Edward how to taste wine slowly. Then they ride motorbikes on the Great Wall of China. Cold wind hurts their faces, but the long wall covered with snow looks like a white dragon. Carter says, “Now I see something truly beautiful.”
They visit the Pyramids in Egypt. Edward pays a guide so they can climb a few stones and watch sunrise. The desert turns gold. Both men are quiet.

*6. Talking under African stars
-On safari they watch lions and tall giraffes. At night Carter points to the bright sky. He tells an old story: after death, the gods ask two things—“Did you find joy?” and “Did you bring joy to others?” Edward listens but says nothing.

*7. A sudden fight
-In California Carter phones his wife. She sounds lonely. He wants to go home. Edward plans to hunt a snow leopard and hides this plan. Carter discovers the secret, calls it cruel, and leaves. They yell on a dusty road, then go different ways. Carter flies home; Edward goes back to his big empty flat.

*8. Family time and bad news
-Carter enjoys warm family dinners, but pain returns. One night he falls. The doctor says the cancer is now in his brain. Edward rushes to the hospital. Carter is weak but smiles. He says the best coffee of his life was on the Great Wall. Edward cries for the first time in many years. Carter dies that night.

*9. Edward keeps his promise
-Carter’s letter asks Edward to speak at his funeral and finish one last job—help a complete stranger. Edward hugs Carter’s daughter, who once fought with him over business. She forgives him. He marks another line on the list.

*10. The final mountain
-Edward’s own cancer grows fast. With his helper Thomas he travels to the Himalayas and leaves Carter’s ashes inside a small cave on the snowy slope. Edward breathes cold air and whispers, “See something majestic—done.”
Back home Edward kisses his newborn granddaughter. “Kiss the most beautiful girl in the world—done,” Thomas writes. Weeks later Edward dies peacefully. Thomas carries Edward’s ashes to the same mountain cave. Two tin boxes now sit side by side. All items on the list are finished, and two friends rest together above the clouds.
