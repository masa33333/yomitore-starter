*1. Diagnosis and discomfort
-Edward Cole, self-made billionaire and strict owner of dozens of hospitals, collapses in his boardroom. Tests reveal stage-four lung cancer. Because of his own “two-beds-per-room” policy he must share a ward. His roommate is Carter Chambers, a calm garage mechanic who once dreamed of becoming a history professor.
Their first conversation is brief: Carter asks about the food; Edward grumbles that it tastes like glue. Yet during endless chemo sessions they hear each other’s stories through the thin curtain—Edward’s broken marriages, Carter’s forty-five years at the same repair shop, both men’s hidden regrets.

*2. The birth of the bucket list
-Unable to sleep, Carter scribbles a heading—“Things to do before I kick the bucket.” Items include “watch something truly glorious,” “help a stranger,” “drive a Shelby Mustang.” Edward wakes, reads the list, and laughs. He adds wilder aims: “sky-dive,” “kiss the most beautiful girl in the world,” “hunt the great white tiger,” “see the world.”
When doctors estimate six to twelve months, Edward proposes a deal: skip further chemo, fund every wish, and travel immediately. Carter hesitates; his wife Virginia depends on his modest pay-cheque. But Virginia recognises the spark in her husband’s eyes and lets him go, whispering, “Find what you lost.”

*3. Free-fall and fast lanes
-They begin at an Arizona airfield. Edward leaps from the plane like a teenager; Carter tumbles after him, terror turning into elation as the parachute blooms. Next stop is California’s Willow Springs Raceway. Carter handles the Shelby with deft gear changes; Edward spins into the infield, roaring with childlike joy.

*4. Walls, pyramids, and rare coffee
-A chartered jet drops them in China. Riding vintage motorbikes along a snow-dusted section of the Great Wall, Carter breathes cold air and declares the grey serpent of stone “truly glorious.” They toast with tiny paper cups of local coffee; Carter marks the line “laugh until I cry.”
In Egypt they bribe a guard, climb partway up Khafre’s pyramid at dawn, and watch sunlight flood the desert. Edward—the man who hated sand in his Italian shoes—falls silent for the first time in years.

*5. Lessons under African skies
-During a Kenyan safari they sleep in canvas tents and swap secrets beside a flickering fire. Carter repeats an Egyptian myth: at the gates of heaven a soul answers two questions—“Did you experience joy?” and “Did you bring joy to others?” Edward scoffs, yet later writes the questions inside his leather planner.

*6. Fracture on the road
-While Edward secretly arranges a snow-leopard hunt in the Himalayas, Carter receives a video of his infant grandson’s first steps. Guilt hits him. When Carter learns about the planned hunt he accuses Edward of missing the list’s real point. Words escalate; friendship shatters beside a dusty runway in India. Carter flies home; Edward returns to a penthouse echoing with emptiness.

*7. Home truths and hospital alarms
-Back in Brooklyn, Carter’s joy fades into headaches. Scans show metastasis to the brain. Edward, after firing and rehiring his loyal assistant Thomas in the same minute, rushes to Carter’s bedside. Carter, half-drowsy, thanks Edward for the Great Wall coffee—“best sip of my life.” Edward weeps openly as Carter slips away that night.

*8. Delivering joy to strangers
-Carter’s funeral letter instructs Edward to finish two lines: help a complete stranger and kiss the most beautiful girl in the world. During the memorial Edward admits his arrogance, then approaches Carter’s estranged daughter and apologises for an old lawsuit that cost her job. She forgives him; line complete.

*9. The Himalayan promise
-Edward’s oncologist gives him mere weeks. He and Thomas hike a glacial path toward Everest’s lower ridges, carrying Carter’s ashes in a blue tin box. Snow crunches underfoot; prayer flags snap in thin air. At a small stone shelter Edward places the box inside a niche, whispering a secular prayer about engines, history books, and late-night chess games.

*10. The final check marks
-Returning to New York, Edward meets his newborn granddaughter. Her tiny fingers curl around one of his, and he kisses her soft cheek. Thomas, grinning, writes the date beside “kiss the most beautiful girl in the world.” Edward dies quietly two weeks later while listening to Count Basie.
Thomas keeps one last promise. He treks back to the Himalayan niche; beside Carter’s tin he sets a second box—Edward’s ashes—and scratches two initials on the rock. Stepping back, he ticks the final box: “see something truly majestic.” Snow begins to fall, covering footprints, but two lifelong strangers turned best friends now rest together above the clouds, every item on their list at last complete.
