**Level 1 (A1) - 120-150 words:**

Meow! I finally arrived in Beijing, China's capital city! When I left the airport, I smelled grilled meat with sweet sauce. It was like walking into a huge barbecue party.

The city is very big! Big roads go around and around in circles, and cars drive without stopping. Outside these roads, tall buildings and old small houses mix together like a chess board. Even a cat like me gets confused about directions!

🐾 Food Adventures
For breakfast, I had something like "Beijing pancake" - thin bread with egg and green onions. The man at the food stand made loud sounds with his cooking tool. It was like my alarm clock!

For lunch, I tried famous duck. The crispy skin goes in thin bread (like a small blanket) with sweet brown sauce. But be careful - it can stick to your whiskers!

I also tried bean soup. It tastes sour, like yogurt mixed with something strange! But when you dip fried bread in it, it becomes very tasty.

🥢 Table Manners
Here, food comes on big plates. The table can turn around in circles! When the food you want comes in front of you, you quickly take it with chopsticks. You must move fast when the table turns!

🏯 History and Cat Curiosity
The old palace with red walls is so big! Stone lion statues are very large. When I sat next to one, I looked like a tiny bean! At night, the gates have beautiful lights.

My next goal is the long wall that goes up and down mountains. I want to run up there with my cat skills and let my tail blow in the wind!

Beijing adventure just started. I will send more emails when fun things happen!

Meow! I've finally reached Beijing, the capital of China! The moment I stepped out of the airport, my nose was hit with the aroma of charcoal-grilled meat mixed with sweet sauce. It felt like wandering into a massive barbecue festival.

The city's scale is absolutely shocking. Main roads form multiple circular rings around the center, with cars flowing endlessly. Beyond these rings, modern skyscrapers and traditional single-story houses are mixed together like a checkerboard pattern, making even my cat sense of direction feel dizzy.

🐾 Culinary Adventures
Breakfast was like a "Beijing-style crepe" - thin dough wrapped around egg and scallions with a crispy texture! The street vendor's spatula hitting the iron plate created sounds that served as my wake-up call.

Lunch featured the famous duck dish. Crispy skin wrapped in thin pancakes (like tiny blankets) with sweet bean sauce, though I had to be careful not to get it stuck on my whiskers!

I courageously tried bean soup too. It's sour, tasting like a mixture of yogurt and something fermented! But surprisingly, when you dip fried bread sticks into it, it becomes quite addictive.

🥢 Dining Etiquette Tips
Here, dishes arrive on large plates placed on round rotating tables. As your desired dish spins to your position, you quickly grab portions with your chopsticks. Timing your paw movements—I mean chopstick movements—with the rotation speed is crucial!

🏯 Historical Weight and Feline Curiosity
The ancient palace with red walls is incredibly vast! Stone lion statues are enormous—when I sat at their feet, I appeared bean-sized in comparison. When night falls, the illuminated gates become breathtakingly beautiful.

My next target is the winding wall that snakes across mountains. I plan to race up there with my cat agility and let my tail flutter dramatically in the wind. Just imagining it makes me excited!

Well, my Beijing exploration has only just begun. I'll email you again when more interesting adventures happen!

**Level 3 (B1) - 220-270 words:**

Meow! I've triumphantly arrived in Beijing, China's magnificent capital! The instant I emerged from the airport terminal, my olfactory senses were overwhelmed by the intoxicating fragrance of charcoal-grilled meat harmoniously blended with rich, sweet glaze. The sensation resembled stumbling into an enormous barbecue wonderland.

The metropolitan scale is absolutely staggering. Concentric ring roads encircle the city center in multiple layers, with vehicular traffic flowing perpetually without cessation. Beyond these arterial circles, towering contemporary skyscrapers and traditional courtyard residences intermingle in a checkerboard configuration so complex that even my finely-tuned feline navigational instincts become thoroughly disoriented.

🐾 Gastronomic Expeditions
My morning meal consisted of what resembled a "Beijing-style crepe" - delicate, paper-thin dough enveloping scrambled eggs and fresh scallions, delivering a satisfying crispy texture! The street vendor's rhythmic spatula strikes against the sizzling iron griddle provided an improvised percussion soundtrack that effectively replaced my alarm clock.

The midday culinary highlight featured the internationally renowned Peking duck. Succulent, crackling skin meticulously wrapped within gossamer-thin pancakes (reminiscent of miniature blankets) accompanied by sweet hoisin sauce, though one must exercise considerable caution to prevent the sticky condiment from adhering to one's whiskers!

I summoned considerable courage to sample the traditional bean curd soup. Its distinctive sour profile resembles an unlikely fusion of yogurt and fermented soybeans! However, when paired with golden-fried breadsticks for dipping, this peculiar combination transforms into an unexpectedly addictive delicacy.

🥢 Sophisticated Dining Protocol
The local dining customs involve elaborate presentations on expansive communal platters positioned atop rotating circular tables. As preferred dishes revolve into optimal position, diners must swiftly secure desired portions using precise chopstick coordination. Mastering the synchronization between rotational velocity and utensil deployment—rather than paw movement—represents essential dining etiquette!

🏯 Historical Gravitas and Feline Inquisitiveness  
The ancient imperial complex, distinguished by its vermillion perimeter walls, encompasses truly breathtaking dimensions! Monumental stone guardian lions tower imposingly overhead—when I positioned myself adjacent to their pedestals, my proportions appeared utterly minuscule. After sunset, dramatic illumination transforms the palatial gates into spectacular architectural showcases.

My subsequent objective involves conquering the serpentine fortification that undulates dramatically across mountainous terrain. I anticipate utilizing my inherent feline agility to ascend those historic ramparts, ultimately allowing my tail to billow majestically in the alpine winds. The mere visualization generates tremendous anticipation!

Thus, my Beijing explorations have merely commenced. I shall dispatch additional correspondence whenever remarkable discoveries warrant documentation!

**日本語版:**

ニャー！ついに中国の首都・北京に着いたよ。空港を出た瞬間、鼻先に飛びこんできたのは "炭火で焼くお肉＋甘いタレ" の香り。まるで巨大バーベキュー広場に迷いこんだ気分。

街はびっくりするほどスケールが大きい。真ん中をぐるっと囲む大通りは何重にも輪っかになって、車が終わりなく走っている。その外側には、高いビルと昔ながらの平屋がチェス盤みたいに交ざり合い、猫のぼくでも方向感覚がフラフラになるほど。

🐾 ごはんの冒険
朝ごはんは "北京版クレープ" みたいな薄い生地に卵とネギをはさんでパリパリ！　屋台のおじさんが鉄板の上をヘラでシャッ！とたたく音が目覚まし代わり。

お昼は有名なアヒル料理。カリカリの皮を薄い皮（まるで小さなブランケット）で巻いて甘いお味噌をつけるんだけど、油断するとヒゲにベタッとくっつく危険アリ。

そして勇気を出して豆のスープもトライ。酸っぱくてヨーグルトと納豆を混ぜたような味！　でも揚げパンを浸すと、なぜかやみつきになるニャ。

🥢 テーブル・マナーの豆知識
ここでは料理が大きなお皿でドン！と置かれ、丸い回転テーブルがくるくる回る。そして好きな料理が目の前に来るたび、すかさず自分のお箸で取るスタイル。回るスピードに合わせて前足──じゃなくてお箸を伸ばすタイミングが重要だよ！

🏯 歴史の重みと猫の好奇心
赤い城壁の旧王宮はとにかく広い！　石のライオン像はとても大きくて、足元に座ってみたら、僕はまるで豆粒サイズ。夜になると門がライトアップされてとてもきれいだよ。

次の目標は、うねうねと山を走る長い城壁。あそこを"猫のフットワーク"で駆け上がり、頂上で尻尾を風にたなびかせるんだ。想像するだけでワクワク！

さて、北京での探検はまだ始まったばかり。また面白いことがあったらメールするので楽しみにしていてね。
