**Level 1 (A1) - 100-130 words:**

Meow! I arrived in Seoul!

First, I was surprised by the airport name. It is "Incheon International Airport." It was built on a man-made island in 2001. The airport works 24 hours every day. It takes 43 minutes to Seoul city center by express train. The train ticket costs less than Narita Airport.

Here are some facts:
• The airport code is "ICN." It is one of the top 5 biggest airports for cargo in the world.
• Airport staff can speak English, Chinese, and Japanese. Signs show three languages, so travelers do not get lost.
• Wi-Fi is free at the airport and in the city. You can connect without a SIM card easily.

Japan and Korea are different in many ways:

Transportation: People use one IC card called "T-money" for subway, bus, and taxi. You can charge it at convenience stores.

Food style: Free side dishes like kimchi come before your main food. You can ask for more for free.

24-hour cafes: Bright cafes stay open all night. People drink coffee and study or work late.

Hangul letters: There are almost no Chinese characters, but Hangul is easy to read once you learn the rules.

Tonight I will stay at a small guesthouse in Myeongdong. I want to try "Hotteok," a sweet snack with cinnamon and brown sugar.

I hope you can feel Seoul's atmosphere while reading this letter!

Meow! I finally arrived in Seoul!

The first thing that surprised me was the airport name - "Incheon International Airport." It was built on an artificial island created by filling in the sea in 2001. This hub airport operates 24 hours a day, even late at night. The journey to Seoul city center takes only 43 minutes by express train (AREX), and the fare is much cheaper than Narita, making access much easier than Japan!

Quick facts:
• Airport code is "ICN." It ranks in the world's top 5 for cargo volume.
• Korean airport staff can speak not only English but also Chinese and Japanese quite well. Information displays show three languages, making it hard to get lost.
• Wi-Fi has many free spots both at the airport and downtown. You can connect quite well even without a SIM card, which is very traveler-friendly.

Differences from Japan:

Transportation card culture: One IC card called "T-money" works for subway, bus, and taxi. You can charge it at convenience stores, and the subway automatically calculates the cheapest transfer routes.

Dining style: Free side dishes like kimchi come out before your main order, and you can get free refills. It's interesting how the table becomes lively before your ordered food arrives!

24-hour cafes: Brightly lit cafes stay open even at midnight, with everyone holding lattes while studying or working. When Japanese people would worry about the last train, here it still feels like "afternoon."

Hangul displays: There are almost no Chinese characters, so it's confusing at first, but since Hangul is phonetic, once you learn the rules, it's surprisingly readable. Just pronouncing station names out loud feels like a language quiz!

Tonight I'm planning to stay at a small guesthouse in Myeongdong. After checking in, I want to buy "Hotteok," a sweet snack from a street vendor. The aroma of cinnamon and brown sugar is said to be perfect for Seoul's cold winter.

My notebook is already waiting for the next page! I hope you can feel Seoul's atmosphere a little while reading this letter.

**Level 3 (B1) - 200-250 words:**

Meow! I've successfully arrived in Seoul!

The first thing that caught my attention was discovering that the airport is called "Incheon International Airport." Built on an artificial island created by land reclamation in 2001, this hub airport operates continuously 24 hours a day. Moreover, it takes just 43 minutes to reach Seoul's city center via the express train (AREX), and the fare is significantly more affordable than Narita, making access considerably more convenient than in Japan!

Interesting tidbits:
• The airport code is "ICN," and it ranks among the world's top 5 in terms of cargo volume.
• Korean airport staff are quite capable of speaking not only English but also Chinese and Japanese. Information displays feature trilingual signage, making navigation much easier for travelers.
• Wi-Fi offers numerous free hotspots both at the airport and throughout the city. You can connect quite reliably even without a SIM card, which demonstrates remarkable hospitality toward tourists.

Key differences from Japan I've noticed:

Transportation card culture: A single IC card called "T-money" covers subway, bus, and taxi payments. Recharging is convenient at any convenience store, and the subway system automatically calculates the most economical transfer routes for you.

Dining customs: Complimentary side dishes such as kimchi are served before your main order arrives, with unlimited refills as standard practice. It's fascinating how the table becomes animated and colorful before your actual meal appears!

24-hour cafe phenomenon: Brilliantly illuminated cafes remain open throughout the night, filled with people clutching lattes while studying or working. During hours when Japanese people would be concerned about catching the last train, here the atmosphere still feels distinctly like "afternoon."

Hangul signage system: The virtual absence of Chinese characters initially proves disorienting, but since Hangul operates as a phonetic writing system, once you grasp the fundamental rules, it becomes surprisingly decipherable. Simply attempting to pronounce station names aloud transforms into an engaging linguistic puzzle!

This evening I'm planning to check into a cozy guesthouse in Myeongdong. After settling in, I intend to purchase "Hotteok," a delectable sweet treat from a street vendor. The aromatic blend of cinnamon and brown sugar is reportedly perfectly suited to Seoul's crisp winter atmosphere.

The notebook in my backpack already has its next page eagerly awaiting! I sincerely hope that while reading this letter, you can experience even a small taste of Seoul's distinctive atmosphere. In my next correspondence, I'll share abundant "small discoveries" found during my urban explorations. Stay tuned!

**日本語版:**

ニャー！ソウルに到着したよ！

まず驚いたのは、空港が「仁川（インチョン）国際空港」だということ。2001年に海を埋め立てて造られた人工島の上にあって、夜遅くでも24時間体制で動き続けるハブ空港なんだって。しかもソウル中心部までは急行列車（AREX）で最短43分、料金も成田よりずっと安いから、日本よりアクセスはずっとラクちん！

◆ サクッとうんちく
・空港コードは「ICN」。貨物量では世界トップ５に入る大きさ。
・韓国の空港スタッフは英語だけでなく中国語・日本語もけっこう話せる。案内表示も３か国語表記で迷いにくいよ。
・Wi‑Fiは空港も市内も無料スポットが多く、SIMなしでもけっこうつながるのは旅行者にやさしいね。

◆ 日本との"ココが違う！"

交通カード文化
　T‑money というICカード１枚で地下鉄もバスもタクシーもOK。チャージはコンビニで済むし、地下鉄の乗り換えも自動で最安ルート計算してくれる。

食事スタイル
　キムチなどのおかずが無料で出てきて、おかわり自由が基本。注文した料理が来る前に、テーブルがにぎやかになるのは面白い！

24時間カフェ
　深夜でも照明ピカピカのカフェが開いていて、みんなラテ片手に勉強や仕事。日本だと終電を気にする時間でも、ここではまだ"午後"みたい。

ハングル表示
　漢字がほぼ無いので最初は戸惑うけど、ハングルは表音文字だから一度ルールを覚えると意外と読める。駅名を声に出して読むだけで語学クイズみたいだよ。

今夜は明洞（ミョンドン）の小さなゲストハウスに泊まる予定。チェックインしたら、屋台で「ホットク」という甘いおやつを買ってみるつもり。シナモンと黒砂糖の香りが寒い冬のソウルにぴったりなんだって。

リュックの中のノートは、もう次のページが待機中！　キミがこの手紙を読みながら、少しでもソウルの空気を感じてくれたらうれしいな。次のメールでは、市内散歩で見つけた「小さな発見」をたっぷり届けるよ。お楽しみに！
