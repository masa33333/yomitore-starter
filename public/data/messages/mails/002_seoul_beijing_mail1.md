**Level 1 (A1) - 80-110 words:**

Meow! Today I walked around Seoul city. Myeongdong street at night has many lights from food stands. I can smell sweet and spicy tteokbokki and butter sugar from hotteok.

I learned about Korean eating manners! In Japan, we hold our rice bowl in our hands when we eat. But in Korea, people leave bowls on the table. It is the opposite! Korean people use spoons more than chopsticks. They eat rice, soup, and bibimbap all with one spoon.

There are many culture differences. When older people come into elevators, young people help with buttons. Many people drink iced coffee all year. I saw water machines on streets where people can fill their bottles for free.

Tomorrow I will visit Gyeongbokgung Palace. People wear colorful traditional clothes there. Then I will go to Hongdae to listen to street music. Finally, I want to try a sauna called "jjimjilbang." But I have fur, so hot places are difficult for me. Maybe 5 seconds is my limit!

Soon I will leave Seoul and fly to Beijing. I will write you a letter from that new city!

**Level 2 (A2) - 120-150 words:**

Meow! Today I spent the whole day walking around Seoul city. Myeongdong streets at night sparkle with lights from street vendors, and the air is filled with the sweet and spicy smell of tteokbokki mixed with the butter-sugar aroma of hotteok.

I discovered something interesting about Korean dining manners! In Japan, we're taught that it's "proper" to hold our rice bowl while eating, but here it's basic to keep dishes on the table. It's completely opposite from Japan! Plus, spoons are much more active than chopsticks - people eat rice, soup, and bibimbap all with this one utensil.

Cultural differences are everywhere. For example, when elderly people enter elevators, younger people automatically take over button duties. Many people drink iced coffee year-round. From a cat's perspective, I found it interesting to see "automatic water dispensers" - purifiers on street corners where people freely refill their bottles.

Tomorrow I'm planning to visit Gyeongbokgung Palace. I hear the colorful traditional costumes are more flashy than any cat, so I'm excited to see them. Then I'll listen to music at Hongdae street performances, and finally relax at a sauna called "jjimjilbang." Though with my fur coat, I'm not great with heat - probably 5 seconds is my limit in a sauna!

So my Seoul stay is almost over. After wandering around a bit more, I'll catch another flight to Beijing. I plan to write you a letter immediately after arriving in that city, so wait for it! Let's continue this journey together, meow!

**Level 3 (B1) - 160-200 words:**

Meow! Today I thoroughly explored Seoul's bustling streets. Myeongdong's thoroughfares transform at nightfall, sparkling with the warm glow of street vendor lights, while the atmosphere becomes saturated with the sweet-spicy aroma of tteokbokki and the rich butter-sugar fragrance of hotteok.

I made a fascinating discovery about Korean dining etiquette! While Japanese culture teaches us that holding our rice bowl while eating demonstrates "proper manners," Korean customs dictate that dishes should remain positioned on the table throughout the meal. It's completely contradictory to Japanese practices! Furthermore, spoons dominate over chopsticks here - people efficiently consume rice, soup, and bibimbap using this single versatile utensil.

Cultural distinctions continue to amaze me. For instance, when elderly individuals board elevators, younger passengers automatically assume responsibility for operating the buttons. Additionally, iced coffee consumption remains popular throughout all seasons. From my feline perspective, I found it particularly intriguing to observe the ubiquitous "automatic hydration stations" - public water purifiers positioned throughout the city where residents freely replenish their bottles.

Tomorrow's itinerary includes visiting Gyeongbokgung Palace, where vibrant traditional hanbok supposedly outshine even the most flamboyant cats - an observation I'm eager to verify personally. Subsequently, I'll immerse myself in Hongdae's dynamic street performances before concluding with a therapeutic session at a "jjimjilbang" sauna facility. However, given my natural fur coat, excessive heat poses challenges - realistically, five seconds represents my maximum tolerance threshold.

Consequently, my Seoul sojourn approaches its conclusion. Following additional leisurely exploration, I'll board another aircraft bound for Beijing. Upon arrival, I intend to compose an immediate correspondence from that ancient metropolis, so please await its delivery! Let's perpetuate this incredible adventure together, meow!

**日本語版:**

ニャー！　今日はソウルの街を歩き回ってきたよ。明洞（ミョンドン）の通りは、夜になると屋台の灯りでキラキラして、トッポッキの甘辛い匂いとホットクのバターシュガーの香りが空気を占領してる。

ところで、韓国のごはんマナーでおもしろかった話！　日本ではお茶碗を手に持って食べるのが"きれい"って教わるけど、こちらでは 器をテーブルに置いたままが基本なんだ。日本と逆なんだね。さらにお箸よりスプーンが大活躍で、ごはんもスープもビビンバも全部これ一本で完結。　

文化の違いはまだまだあるにゃ。たとえばエレベーターで年上の人が乗ってきたら、若い人がボタン係を買って出るとか、カフェでアイスコーヒーを一年中飲む人が多いとか。猫視点だと、通りのあちこちに"自動給水器"みたいな浄水器があって、ボトルを自由に補充してるのも面白い光景だった。

明日は景福宮を見に行く予定。色とりどりの伝統衣装は、どの猫よりも派手らしいのでそれを見るのが楽しみ。それから弘大（ホンデ）のストリートパフォーマンスで音楽を聴いて、最後はチムジルバンと呼ばれるサウナで癒やされてこようと思う。僕は毛皮があるので、本当は暑いのは苦手なんだよね。サウナも５秒が限界。

そんなわけで、ソウル滞在もあとわずか。しばらくブラブラしたら、また飛行機で北京へ向かうよ。着いたらすぐ、あの街から手紙を書くつもりだから待っててね！　一緒に旅を続けようにゃ〜！
