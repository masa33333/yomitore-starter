**Level 1 (A1) - 80-100 words:**

Meow! I am flying to Seoul now. The plane is high above Japan. I can see small clouds under us. They look like big white pillows.

My seat is in the middle. Two people sit next to me. The man on my left sleeps and makes loud sounds. I cannot read my book well. The woman on my right drinks orange juice.

A flight worker comes with drinks. She spills a little orange juice. It smells sweet and good. Outside the window, I see big white clouds everywhere.

Soon we will get small bread and warm soup. I always like airplane food. It is different from home food.

I will send my next message from Seoul city. Let's keep reading together!

**Level 2 (A2) - 110-140 words:**

Meow! I'm flying above Japan right now, heading to Seoul. The seatbelt sign just turned on and I felt a strong push against my back. My ears popped during takeoff. I always feel nervous during takeoff moments.

My seat is in the middle of three seats. Both passengers beside me have taken over the armrests, so I have no place to put my paws. The older man on my left fell asleep quickly and snores like a dinosaur. Because of this, I can't concentrate on reading my book.

A flight attendant pushes a drink cart through the aisle. Every time she passes, a little orange juice spills on the tray and fills the air with sweet smells. Outside the window, fluffy clouds spread out like giant soft pillows.

Soon they will serve small bread and warm soup. It's simple, but it's a feast on airplanes. I always look forward to airline meals.

I'll send my next message after arriving in Seoul. Let's continue reading and traveling together!

**Level 3 (B1) - 140-180 words:**

Meow! I'm currently flying over Japan, heading toward Seoul. The seatbelt sign just illuminated and I felt myself pressed firmly back into my seat as my ears popped. Takeoff moments always make me feel tense and excited at the same time.

My assigned seat happens to be the dreaded middle seat in a row of three. Both passengers on either side have completely claimed the armrests, leaving absolutely no space for my front paws. The gentleman to my left dozed off almost immediately and produces thunderous snores that remind me of prehistoric dinosaurs. This makes it practically impossible to concentrate on reading my book.

Every time the cabin crew member wheels her beverage cart down the narrow aisle, a few drops of orange juice splash onto the service tray, releasing a delightfully sweet aroma that drifts through the cabin. Through the small aircraft window, I can observe fluffy white clouds stretching endlessly like enormous comfortable pillows floating in the sky.

In a short while, they'll distribute modest portions of bread accompanied by steaming soup. Though humble, these simple meals feel like genuine feasts when you're traveling at thirty thousand feet. There's something special about airline food that differs from our everyday dining experiences, don't you think?

My next correspondence will reach you after I've touched down in Seoul. Let's continue reading extensively and keep this incredible journey alive together!

**日本語版:**

ニャー！いま日本の上空を飛んで、ソウルへ向かっているよ。シートベルトのランプが光って、ぐっと背中が押され、耳がポンと詰まった。離陸の瞬間はいつも緊張しちゃう。

今回ぼくの席は3人掛けの真ん中。両隣の人が両方のひじ掛けを占領しているから、ぼくの"前足"を置く場所がないんだ。左隣のおじさんはすぐに眠ってしまい、恐竜みたいないびきをかいている。おかげで本を読んでも内容が頭に入らないよ。

客室乗務員さんがドリンクカートを押して通るたび、オレンジジュースがちょっとだけトレーにこぼれて甘い香りが漂う。窓の外にはふわふわの雲がまるで大きな枕みたいに広がっている。

もうすぐ小さなパンと温かいスープが出るはず。ささやかだけど、機内ではごちそうだね。機内食っていつも楽しみなんだ。普段の食事とはちょっと違うよね、そう思わない？

次のメールはソウルに着いたあとに送るよ。これからもいっしょに読んで、旅を続けようね！
