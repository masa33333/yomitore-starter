OAKFIELD (April 15) â€“ The Oakfield city council yesterday unveiled a new city-wide recycling program, the "Green Bin" initiative, set to launch on June 1. The program aims to significantly reduce the amount of household waste sent to landfills by introducing the collection of organic waste, including all food scraps and soiled paper products.

Each household will receive a small kitchen container and a larger green-colored outdoor bin by mid-May. Residents will be instructed to separate their organic waste using these new containers. The city's waste management department will add a weekly green bin pickup to its existing schedule for garbage and recyclables.

"This is a major step forward in our city's commitment to environmental sustainability," said Mayor Susan Croft. "While it may require a small adjustment for residents, the long-term benefits for our community and environment are immense." The city's official website has been updated with detailed information, including a complete list of acceptable materials and a revised pickup schedule. Information sessions will also be held at community centers throughout May.
