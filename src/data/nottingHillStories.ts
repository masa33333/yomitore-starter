  1: `**1. Two different lives
--Notting Hill is a small part of west London. The streets are colourful; many people sell fruit, clothes, and used things on Portobello Road.
There is a tiny travel-book shop on that road. William (Will) Thacker owns it. He is 35, quiet, and kind. After a hard divorce he now lives in a small house with a funny flat-mate, Spike. Spike is from Wales and often walks in the house wearing only underpants.

Far away in Hollywood lives Anna Scott, maybe the most famous movie star in the world. Magazines show her face every week. Reporters follow her all day.
Will is "a normal man." Anna is "a superstar." But both feel lonely in their own way.

**2. A surprise in the book shop
--One morning the shop was almost empty. At 11 o'clock a woman in dark glasses came in. She looked at books about Turkey. Will soon knew who she was: Anna Scott! He tried to stay calm. She chose one book, paid, and left with a small smile.

Five minutes later Will left the shop to buy orange juice. As he turned the corner he walked straight into Anna. The paper cup broke. Juice covered her white blouse.
Will said "sorry!" many times. He offered his house nearby so she could clean her clothes. Anna agreed.

At Will's house she changed into a T-shirt that said "Get Laid in Iceland" (Spike's joke T-shirt). She laughed at the words. Before leaving, Will suddenly asked, "Would you like tea or coffee with me one day?"
Anna thought for a second, wrote her phone number on paper, and said "maybe." Then a car took her away.

**3. A very strange meeting at the hotel
--Will planned to call Anna the next day, but her helper phoned first. Anna had press interviews at the Ritz hotel. Will could meet her there in the afternoon.

Will put on an old suit and went to the hotel. He forgot Anna's secret code name "Flintstone," so the staff were confused. At last a worker sent him to Anna's room. A long line of reporters waited. A staff member thought Will was a reporter and pushed him inside.

Anna sat on a sofa, bored. She whispered, "Pretend you are a reporter." Will knew nothing about news work, so he said he wrote for a kids' magazine called Horse & Hound! He asked silly questions about space films, horses, and dogs. Anna answered and tried not to laugh. When the real reporters were gone, Anna said sorry for the mix-up and asked Will to have dinner that evening.

But Will had a promise: he must go to his sister Honey's birthday dinner. Anna said, "No problem. Ask if I can come." Will agreed.

**4. Birthday dinner with friends
--At the dinner table were:

Max and Bella – Will's best friends; Bella now used a wheelchair.

Bernie – a kind but clumsy banker.

Honey – Will's lively sister, now 27.

Will, very nervous.

Anna, wearing simple clothes, no make-up.

At first nobody knew she was famous. Then Honey screamed, Bernie asked many funny questions, and Bella told her sad story about acting school. Anna listened and laughed; she felt normal for once.

After dinner they played a game: who had the worst life would win the last piece of cake. Each person spoke. Anna said her armpits looked bad after shaving. The others laughed and gave her the cake.

Later Anna and Will walked home. Outside Will's gate they shared a small kiss. Anna left with a happy smile.

**5. Reporters everywhere
--The next morning Spike opened the front door wearing only grey pants. Flash! Flash! A crowd of paparazzi took photos. Someone had told the newspapers Anna stayed at Will's house.

Reporters shouted rude questions. Anna was afraid and angry. Will tried to stop the crowd but could not. In the papers the next day the headline was "ANNA & NOBODY?" Anna felt hurt. That night she climbed over the back fence and flew to America without saying goodbye.

Will was heart-broken. He worked, ate cheap food, and tried to forget her, but he could not.

**6. Meeting again, but saying no
--Six months passed. One day Anna called the book shop. She was back in London for a new film and wanted to see Will. They met in the closed shop at night. Anna said sorry for leaving. She also said her American boyfriend had sold private phone calls to the press, so she trusted almost no one now.

Will listened but was still afraid of new pain. He said he could not start again. Anna looked sad and left.

**7. Love wins at the press conference
--A few days later Spike shouted, "Will, come see the TV!" On the screen Anna answered questions at a press conference. A nasty reporter asked if she liked breaking a "normal man's" heart. Anna stopped, then said softly,

"I'm just a girl, standing in front of a boy, asking him to love her."

Will's heart jumped. Spike yelled, "Go to her!"
Will and his friends raced by car to the hotel. He ran into the press room, out of breath. Reporters turned to look. Will said he had been stupid and asked Anna if she would still have dinner with him.

Anna's face changed from shock to joy. She said "yes." Cameras flashed, but this time everyone cheered.

Later Anna finished her film in London and often visited Will's shop. They took one friendly photo for the newspaper, then asked the reporters to leave them alone.

Some months later Will and Anna had a small wedding in a garden. Friends and family danced under lights. Time passed. One sunny day Will sat on a park bench reading a book. Anna, now pregnant, lay with her head on his shoulder. They were happy, and Notting Hill felt like the best place in the world.`,

  2: `**1. A Colourful London Street
--Notting Hill, in west London, is famous for its Saturday market. Every morning fruit sellers lift heavy boxes, clothes traders hang bright shirts, and tourists look for cheap antiques on Portobello Road. Halfway along the street stands a narrow travel-book shop. The owner, William Thacker, is thirty-five. He is friendly, careful with money, and still sad about a divorce that happened two years ago.

William lives five minutes away with a Welsh flat-mate named Spike. Spike is kind but messy. He often walks through the house wearing only old underpants and talks to himself while searching for clean socks. William accepts Spike's strange habits because London rent is high.

**2. A Very Famous Customer
--Late one Tuesday morning a woman in dark glasses enters the shop. She wears simple jeans and a cap. William welcomes her. After a moment he realises the woman is Anna Scott, one of the most famous film stars in the world. He stays calm, shows her a guidebook about Turkey, and takes her credit card. Anna thanks him and leaves.

Only five minutes later William buys a paper cup of orange juice. He turns a corner and bumps straight into Anna. The cup bursts; orange juice covers her white blouse. William apologises again and again. He offers his nearby house, so she can clean her clothes. Anna says yes.

**3. "Get Laid in Iceland"
--At the house William searches Spike's wardrobe and finds one clean T-shirt. The words "Get Laid in Iceland" are printed across the chest. Anna laughs and puts it on. She is about to leave when William suddenly says, "Would you like to drink coffee with me some time?" Anna writes her phone number on a scrap of paper and says, "Maybe."

In the afternoon an assistant phones the shop. Anna is giving short interviews at the Ritz hotel. If William wants to see her, he can come at four o'clock. William borrows an old suit from Spike and rushes to the hotel.

**4. Horse & Hound
--At the hotel William forgets Anna's secret code name, "Flintstone." The staff think he is a reporter and send him into a suite already full of journalists. Anna sits on a sofa. She whispers, "Pretend you are from a magazine." William invents a children's magazine called Horse & Hound and asks about her space film, horses, and dogs. Anna answers, trying not to laugh.

When the real reporters leave, Anna invites William to dinner. William explains he must attend his sister Honey's birthday party. Anna smiles and offers to join the party instead.

**5. A Birthday to Remember
--That evening William's kitchen is full. At the table are:

Max and Bella – William's best friends. Bella uses a wheelchair after an accident.

Bernie – a banker who never notices famous people.

Honey – William's lively sister, crazy about celebrities.

William, worried.

Anna, wearing no make-up and simple clothes.

At first nobody recognises her. Honey suddenly realises and screams with joy. Bernie asks Anna which part of the movie business she cleans. Everyone laughs when he discovers the truth. After dinner the group play a game: whoever has the worst problem wins the last slice of cake. Anna jokes that her underarms look terrible after shaving, so the others give her the cake.

After the party Anna and William walk through quiet streets. Outside his gate they share a small kiss. Anna leaves with a gentle smile.

**6. Cameras Crash the Peace
--Next morning Spike opens the front door wearing only grey pants. A crowd of paparazzi with flashing cameras fill the street. Somebody told them that Anna spent the night at William's house. Reporters shout rude questions. Anna is frightened and angry. Newspapers next day scream "ANNA & NOBODY?" Anna blames Spike and also William. That night she climbs over the back fence and flies to the United States without saying goodbye.

William is heart-broken. He works in the shop, eats cheap takeaway food, and tries to forget. Friends arrange dates, but he still thinks of Anna.

**7. A Second Meeting
--Six months later Anna returns to London to shoot a film. She calls William and asks to meet after closing time. In the silent shop she says sorry for leaving. She explains that her American boyfriend sold private phone messages to the press, so she trusts nobody. William listens but fears new pain. He decides not to begin again. Anna leaves in tears.

**8. Words That Change Everything
--A few days later Spike tells William to look at the television. Anna is speaking at a press conference. A rude reporter asks if she enjoys breaking a "normal man's" heart. Anna pauses, then says,

"I'm just a girl, standing in front of a boy, asking him to love her."

Spike shouts, "She means you!" William grabs Bernie's car keys. Spike, Honey, Max, and Bella jump in too. They race through London, make wrong turns, and reach the hotel as Anna leaves the stage. William, out of breath, tells her he was stupid and asks for another chance. Anna smiles and says "yes." Reporters cheer.

**9. A New Life Together
--A quiet photo of Anna and William standing outside the travel shop appears once in a newspaper. After that reporters lose interest. Months later the couple marry in Max and Bella's garden. Spike forgets the rings but finds them in time. Honey dates the best man.

One sunny afternoon William sits on a park bench reading. Anna, now pregnant, lies with her head on his lap. A single photographer takes one photo from far away, but the couple do not notice. They have mixed their worlds—film sets and market stalls, red carpets and second-hand books—and found a peaceful life in Notting Hill.`,

  3: `**1. Market Noise and Quiet Books
--Portobello Road wakes early. Stalls clang open; traders spread bright cloths to protect fruit from the sun; visitors search for treasures among boxes of bric-à-brac. Near the centre stands a narrow shop with a fading wooden board: "The Travel Book Co." Inside, shelves are full of guides to deserts, cold mountains, and lost cities. William Thacker manages the place with gentle humour, though the business barely covers his rent.

William's private life is equally modest. Two years after a difficult divorce he shares a crumbling house with Spike, an untidy Welsh man who enjoys loud guitar music and walks around in underwear bearing strange slogans. William often tidies the kitchen while Spike sings into a hairbrush.

**2. A Superstar in Disguise
--Late on a warm Tuesday morning a woman wearing sunglasses and a baseball cap walks into the shop. She browses travel guides on Turkey. William approaches, ready to help, and suddenly realises he is serving Anna Scott, one of Hollywood's most famous actresses. He keeps his voice steady, completes the sale, and watches her leave.

Five minutes later William buys an orange-juice carton. Turning a corner, he collides with Anna. The juice explodes, soaking her white blouse. William apologises and, embarrassed, invites her to his nearby house to change. Anna smiles and accepts.

**3. T-Shirt Diplomacy
--Spike's wardrobe offers one clean garment: a bright turquoise T-shirt reading "Get Laid in Iceland." Anna laughs and puts it on. Before leaving, William gathers his courage and asks if she might like coffee sometime. She pauses, writes her number on a scrap of paper, and says, "Maybe."

That afternoon an assistant calls. Anna is spending the day giving interviews at the Ritz under the code name "Flintstone." If William comes at four, she can spare five minutes.

**4. Horse & Hound Improvisation
--William borrows Spike's least offensive suit and reaches the Ritz, where staff confuse him for a journalist. Inside a suite crowded with reporters Anna silently instructs him to act like one. William invents Horse & Hound, "Britain's leading magazine on equestrian space travel," and asks absurd questions about saddles in zero gravity. Anna answers with professional calm while hiding a grin.

When the press session ends Anna invites William to dinner. He explains that he must attend his sister Honey's birthday. Anna offers to come. William, half terrified, agrees.

**5. Dinner, Cake, and Honest Stories
--That evening William's kitchen hosts an unusual set of guests:

Max, a chef turned stockbroker, and his wife Bella, recently using a wheelchair.

Bernie, a banker who never recognises famous faces.

Honey, whose excitement often outruns her good sense.

William, sweating in silence.

Anna Scott, dressed simply, no make-up, enjoying a moment away from cameras.

At first nobody realises who she is. Bernie asks what part of the film industry she cleans. Honey, sudden recognition glowing in her eyes, almost cries with delight. Bella speaks with Anna about acting dreams and lost chances.

After dinner Max brings a sticky-toffee pudding. They invent a game: the person with the worst life earns the last slice. Bella jokes about daily wheelchair problems, Bernie laments constant financial failure, and Anna, pretending to be average, comments on terrible under-arm shaving. The table votes to give her the cake.

Walking home in soft lamplight, Anna thanks William for the honest evening. Outside his gate she kisses him. William, stunned, watches her ride away.

**6. Fame Breaks the Door
--Next morning Spike opens the front door wearing only underwear and decorative goggles. Dozens of paparazzi wait outside. They learned Anna spent the night in the house. Flashbulbs strobe; reporters shout. Anna, trapped in the kitchen, panics. The headline "ANNA & NOBODY?" fills morning papers. Furious, she blames Spike—who told a friend in the pub—then blames William. That night she scales the back fence and catches a flight to Los Angeles without farewell.

William drifts into grey routine. He serves guidebooks, eats supermarket pasta, and agrees to hopeless blind dates arranged by friends. Nothing helps; memories of Anna remain.

**7. Six Months Later
--Half a year passes. Anna returns to London to film a Henry James adaptation. She calls William. They meet in the closed shop at dusk. Anna apologises but explains her trust was broken when her American boyfriend sold private voicemail messages to tabloids. William listens, feels fear of fresh pain, and decides against restarting the relationship. Anna leaves, eyes bright with unshed tears.

**8. A Press Conference Confession
--A few days later Spike bursts into the shop, shouting about the television. Anna is at a press conference. A hostile reporter asks if she likes destroying an ordinary man's heart. Anna pauses, then replies:

"Yes, a man owns a travel-book shop in Notting Hill. I hurt him. But now I'm just a girl, standing in front of a boy, asking him to love her."

Spike yells, "That's you, mate!"

**9. A Wild London Chase
--William drags Spike, Honey, Max, and Bella into Bernie's tiny car. They race through traffic, miss the hotel entrance, reverse down a one-way street, and finally burst into the hotel ballroom just as the conference ends. Reporters stare. William apologises publicly, admits he was stupid, and asks Anna to dinner. Anna smiles and says "yes." The room explodes in applause and camera flashes, but for once the noise feels friendly.

**10. After the Headlines Fade
--One polite photograph of Anna and William outside the book shop appears in a newspaper under the headline "HAPPY IN NOTTING HILL." Reporters soon move on to new scandals.

Months later Anna and William marry in Max and Bella's garden. Spike forgets the rings, finds them inside his shoe, and becomes best-man by accident. Honey dances with a waiter.
When Anna rests between films she helps William rearrange dusty shelves; when she travels, William closes the shop early and joins her on set.

**11. A Quiet Park Scene
--One spring afternoon William reads aloud from a travel guide to Greece while sitting on a park bench. Anna, now pregnant, lies with her head on his lap. A single photographer, hidden behind a tree, captures the moment. The caption next day reads, "STAR ENJOYS PEACE."

William and Anna no longer mind the occasional lens. They have mixed two worlds—bookshop calm and red-carpet rush—and built a life that feels balanced. In busy London, love and ordinary days finally belong to both of them.`
